Fields, E. C. (2024). Bayes factors cannot provide evidence for the null hypothesis. PsyArXiv Preprints. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/d6u5p


**The following scripts are included:** 

* `BF_simulations.R`: Examine how the frequentist t-test and Bayes factors with different alternative models perform with different sample sizes and population effect sizes via simulations.

* `BF_ttest_example.R`: An example of the Bayes factor in a study with a small observed effect.
 
* `BF_ttest_largestCI.R`: Find the largest upper bound on a confidence interval when the Bayes factor supports the null within a set of parameters.
  
* `BFbyN.R`: Examine the Bayes factor by sample size with a given observed effect size.
  
* `cauchy_visualization.R`: Code to create a visualization and probability table of the Cauchy distribution used in the default Bayes factor.
  
* `CI_width_by_sample_size.R`: Find the margin of error for the confidence interval on Cohen's d by sample size in independent and paired samples designs.
